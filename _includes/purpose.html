                The Purdue CS 190 Tools course was introduced in Fall of 2013 by the <a href="http://cs.purdue.edu/usb">CS Undergraduate Student Board</a> as a response to the need of new CS students to learn basic tools. We are dedicated to providing students with the tools they need early in their careers and put them on a path to success in Computer Science.
